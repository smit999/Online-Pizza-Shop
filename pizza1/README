README for pizza1

This project is set up to be installed at /cs637/username/pizza1
relative to the document root, where username is your topcat username.

Under Windows XAMPP, at \xampp\htdocs\cs637\username\pizza1
Under Mac OSX XAMPP, at /Applications/XAMPP/xampfiles/cs637/username/pizza1
Under Linux XAMPP, at /opt/lampp/cs637/username/pizza1

On pe07, at /var/www/html/cs637/username/pizza1
You have private access to this area using UNIX file permissions,
just as you have private access to your ~/cs637 directory area.

To be ready to run this project on topcat, you need to edit in your
topcat username in two places in these sources, as explained in
comments in these files:
1. in model/database.php
2. in view/header.php 
To run it with XAMPP, only the second one is needed, but the first
one doesn't hurt, so it is recommended to do both at once.

Once these edits are done, the project is set up to be deployed
at c:\xampp\htdocs\cs637\username\pizza1   for XAMPP on Windows
at /Application/XAMPP/htdocs/cs637/username/pizza1   for XAMPP on Mac
at /opt/lampp/htdocs/cs637/username/pizza1   for XAMPP on Linux
at /var/www/html/cs637/username/pizza1 for apache on pe07
where username is your topcat username.
