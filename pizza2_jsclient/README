Pizza Shop with JS single-page app for students

Uses PHP Slim server in pizza2_server project to access pizzadb in mysql and support
webservices used by JS via Ajax.
The Slim server depends on the Apache webserver's URL-rewriting capability, 
so we can't use the Netbeans internal server on its port 8383 for the server.
Thus the baseUrl in use in app.js specifies port 80 for the server, i.e. 
Apache of XAMPP or Apache on pe07. With the client side running on
port 8383 and the server on 80, this counts as cross-origin resource
sharing (CORS), so it matters that our Slim server supports that kind of access.

To execute this app under Netbeans: using CORS (two servers in use by browser) 
1. make sure xampp is running Apache and mysql, for the server side on port 80
   and pizza2_server is working 
2. if first time, load mysql using files in database directory
3. Run index.html from Netbeans, thus serving it from port 8383

To execute this app purely on XAMPP: no CORS here (only one server in use by browser)
1. copy this directory to /xampp/htdocs/cs637/username/pizza_jsclient 
2. make sure xampp is running Apache and mysql and pizza2_server is working 
3. if first time, load mysql using files in database directory
4. browse to index.html (URL localhost/cs637/username/pizza2_jsclient/pizza/index.html)

To execute this app on pe07: no CORS here (only one server in use)
1. copy this directory to /var/www/html/cs637/username/pizza2_jsclient 
2. if first time, load mysql using files in database directory
    and make sure your pizza2_server is working on pe07 
3. browse to index.html via your tunnel to pe07 port 80
   (URL localhost:8000/cs637/username/pizza2_jsclient/index.html)
