README for pizza2_phpclient

This project is set up to be installed at /cs637/username/pizza2_phpclient
relative to the document root, where username is your pe07 username.
It is designed to use web services provided by a PHP Slim server in the 
../pizza2_server project to access the pizza db in mysql on the same system.

On pe07, this project is meant to be installed at
/var/www/html/cs637/username/pizza2_phpclient.
You have private access to this area using UNIX file permissions,
just as you have private access to your ~/cs637 directory area.

To be ready to run this project, you need to edit in your
pe07 username in just one place in these sources, view/header.php,
as explained in a comment in that files.

The harder part is to supply the needed pizza2_server project that
implements the needed web services. It is expected to be available at
/cs637/username/pizza2_server relative to the document root, i.e. at
../pizza2_server relative to this project. The server side needs a loaded 
mysql server.

To run this project on your own system, browse to localhost/cs637/username/pizza2_phpclient.
To run it once installed on pe07, browse to localhost:8000/cs637/username/pizza2_phpclient,
using your tunnel to pe07's port 80.
